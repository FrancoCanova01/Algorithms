# You are visiting a farm to collect fruits. The farm has a single row of fruit trees.
# You will be given two baskets, and your goal is to pick as many fruits as possible 
# to be placed in the given baskets.

# You will be given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree. The farm has following restrictions:

# Each basket can have only one type of fruit. There is no limit to how many fruit a 
# basket can hold.
# You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started.
# You will pick exactly one fruit from every tree until you cannot, 
# i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
# Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both baskets.

# Example 1:
# Input: arr=['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C']  
# Output: 3  
# Explanation: We can put 2 'C' in one basket and one 'A' in the other from the subarray ['C', 'A', 'C']

# Example 2:
# Input: arr = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']  
# Output: 5  
# Explanation: We can put 3 'B' in one basket and two 'C' in the other basket. 
# This can be done if we start with the second letter: ['B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']
